@MISC{comment:polConv,
 note    = {Note that in Ref.\ \cite{Baddour:2009}, Eq.~(\ref{eq:polConv}) is 
 formulated in terms of the $2$D Fourier transform $F_0^{\rm FT}$ of $f$, 
 which, in case of a radially symmetric functions is related to the 
 Fourier-Bessel transform via $F_0^{\rm FT}(\rho)=2\pi F_0(\rho)$. }
